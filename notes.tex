Big O is a set, i.e. a category.
$10n = O(n)$ is a shortcut for $10n \in O(n)$.  We know that $10n$ is in the category of functions shaped
like $n$.  

Likewise, $10n^3 + 75n^2 - 5200n + 1000007$ is in the category of functions shaped like $n^3$, so it is $O(n^3)$.

Formally:
$$ O(g(n)) = \left\{ {f(n) | \exists c,n_0 > 0 \land f(n) \leq c\bullet g(n), \forall n>n_0 }\right\}$$
