\begin{itemize}
    \item Here is my code:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    \end{lstlisting}
>    \item Complexity is denoted in comments
    \item I have three arrays: one 2-d array which contains the cost between any two cities, and two single-dimension 
arrays, each of which contain indexes pointing from one city to another, for forward and reverse edges.
    \item I used an "optimized priority queue" I found on Github (at \url{https://github.com/
        BlueRaja/High-Speed-Priority-Queue-for-C-Sharp}).  It's an array-based heap, with classic
        heapify and bubbling operations.
    \item I simply add all the cities to a route, in reverse order.  I mark any cities which aren't connected.  
I then proceed to "randomize" the route iterating through the marked cities and swapping them with randomly chosen
cities from the route.  I do this a few times and choose the lowest-cost randomized naive route. 
>    \item Add a debug printer with cities/seed, time, max # of states (maximum size of the queue), solNum, and pruned states
